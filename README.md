4. No prerequisite.

5. You will be brought to a sign in page where you put in your username and password or if you are a new user you will go to a registration page where you will create a username and passwords as well as put in a address you want to use to find nearby polls. You will then be brought to our main page which will provide polls closest to you so you can go and vote. There is also an info tab that states our mission as well as what our website entails. The website will also let you update your address so you can get new up to date polling stations from wherever you are in the US.

6. We will test our website first by testing our API, We have alredy run tests with just the API and it runs well, but we need to test its functionality with the website so we will Register with our website with an address and see if we get the polling locations when brought to the homepage. We will check to see if they are truly the closest and in the correct order. We will also test users who have already registered and make sure that the polling stations are acurate and that the website has saved your information correctly. We will also be testing features such as changing addresses and passwords.
